I made this project for STAT 557 - Data Mining in the fall of 2023 - the second year of my masters at Penn State.

I collaborated on this project with my friend Lindsey (see his profile here: https://github.com/llb5404). The main goal of the project was to illustrate the computational proccess used in gradient descent algorithms in a relatively simple context, while forcing us to manually implement the computational techniques, subject to runtime constraints and memory constraints (which I unfortunately do not remember the exact constraints). This particular algorithm could be noticeably optimized, and my skills have improved significantly since (as of October 2025).
